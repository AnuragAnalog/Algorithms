# Dynamic Programming

It is an optimization technique, in which we store the values in an array which we use later in the program rather than recomputing again and again.

## Problems

**Factorial**

Compute factorial

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| O(n) | O(n) |

**GCD of continguous Sequences of an array**

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| O(n^2) | O(n^2) |

**Binomial Coefficients**

Compute binomial co-efficients.

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
